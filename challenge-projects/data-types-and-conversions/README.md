# Convert data types using casting and conversion techniques

This challenge includes two problems.

1. Combine string array data as strings and as integers.
	* starter code: `string[] values = { "12.3", "45", "ABC", "11", "DEF" };`
	* Rule 1: If the value is alphabetical, concatenate it to form a message.
	* Rule 2: If the value is numeric, add it to the total.
	
2. Output math operations as specific number types.
	* starter code:
	```
		int value1 = 12;
		decimal value2 = 6.2m;
		float value3 = 4.3f;

		// Your code here to set result1
		// Hint: You need to round the result to nearest integer (don't just truncate)
		Console.WriteLine($"Divide value1 by value2, display the result as an int: {result1}");

		// Your code here to set result2
		Console.WriteLine($"Divide value2 by value3, display the result as a decimal: {result2}");

		// Your code here to set result3
		Console.WriteLine($"Divide value3 by value1, display the result as a float: {result3}");
	```
